# Causal ML Treatment Effect

This project implements an end-to-end **causal inference pipeline** to estimate the true effect of a treatment (e.g., product exposure, marketing campaign) on user conversions.  
It combines state-of-the-art methods from statistics and machine learning with clear diagnostics and business impact translation.
